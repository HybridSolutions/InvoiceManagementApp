ASP.NET Core 3.1 Clean Architecture – Invoice Management App

A while ago I saw a youtube video of Jason Taylor’s talk in NDC Conference about clean architecture. He present a source code which you can use as a template for your new project which is already structured based on clean architecture. If you follow the convention on how the code should be written based on his template, coding will be a lot easier for you.
